Login and go to the Administration tab.\r\n2. Click on Boost.\r\n3. Click on Other Modules\r\n4. Install any of the modules included. We recommend you try them all.\r\n\r\n**Remember after you install to restrict your directory permissions.**\r\n\r\nThese directories should always be writable and executable by Apache:\r\n* files/\r\n* images/\r\n* logs/\r\n\r\nThese directories should be writable and executable by Apache only during module or core installs, updates, and uninstalls:\r\n* javascript/\r\n* templates/\r\n\r\nAdditional permission suggestions:\r\n* logs/     should NOT be world readable\r\n* setup/    should be moved or made unreadable AFTER an installation\r\n* convert/  should be removed after converting\r\n\r\n**Before updating the core, make sure to make a copy of your\r\nconfig/core directory or some of your settings could get\r\noverwritten.**\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading, the only file you must keep in your config/core\r\ndirectory is language.php.\r\n\r\nphpWebSite uses UTF-8 character encoding. Some older database versions\r\nof MySQL (pre 4.1) do not support it.\r\n\r\nVagrant\r\n=======\r\nphpWebSite can now be run in a Vagrant Box!\r\n\r\n1. Install VirtualBox and Vagrant as per instructions for your platform\r\n2. Create a new Vagrant Box called 'centos64' from the URL\r\n   http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/centos-64-x64-vbox4210.box\r\n   on Linux or Mac, this is done like so:\r\n   ```vagrant box add centos64 http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/centos-64-x64-vbox4210.box```\r\n3. ```vagrant up```!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
